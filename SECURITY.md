# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Commitment to Security

The Zirar project is committed to maintaining the highest security standards while promoting ethical use of security tools. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from the security community.

## üéØ Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The main Zirar application (`main.py`)
- All supporting modules and dependencies
- Documentation and educational materials
- Build and deployment processes

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Process

We follow industry-standard responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Report security issues privately before public disclosure
2. **Coordinated Timeline**: Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
3. **Credit and Recognition**: Security researchers will be credited appropriately
4. **No Legal Action**: We commit to not pursuing legal action against good-faith security researchers

### How to Report

**üîí For Security Vulnerabilities:**
- **Email**: [Create a private GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/Mr3rf1/zirar/security/advisories/new)
- **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability in Zirar: [Brief Description]"
- **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive communications (if available)

**üìã Include in Your Report:**
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: Initial triage within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: Progress updates every 7 days
4. **Resolution Timeline**: Fix deployment within 30 days for critical issues
5. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix deployment

## üîç Security Considerations

### Application Security

**Input Validation:**
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- File paths are checked for directory traversal attempts
- Password lists are processed safely

**Memory Management:**
- Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
- Password strings are handled securely
- Temporary files are cleaned up properly

**Thread Safety:**
- Multi-threading implementation uses proper synchronization
- Shared resources are protected with appropriate locks
- Race conditions are prevented

### Ethical Use Enforcement

**Built-in Safeguards:**
- Ethical use confirmation dialogs
- Clear warnings about authorized use only
- Educational content emphasizing responsible use
- No features that facilitate unauthorized access

**User Education:**
- Comprehensive documentation on ethical use
- Links to responsible disclosure guidelines
- Security best practices recommendations
- Legal and ethical considerations

## üéì Educational Security Practices

### Teaching Responsible Security

This project demonstrates:
- **Proper Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

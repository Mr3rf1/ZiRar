## 📋 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: 512MB RAM minimum
- **Storage**: 50MB free space

### Dependencies
```bash
PySide6>=6.5.0      # Modern Qt-based GUI framework
pyzipper>=0.3.6     # Enhanced ZIP file handling
rarfile>=4.0        # RAR archive support
```

### Additional Requirements for RAR Support
- **Windows**: Download UnRAR from [rarlab.com](https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm)
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install unrar`
- **macOS**: `brew install unrar`

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr3rf1/ZiRar.git
cd ZiRar
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup RAR Support (Optional)
```bash
# Run the setup helper for Windows
python setup_unrar.py

# Or install manually:
# Windows: Download from https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm
# Linux: sudo apt-get install unrar
# macOS: brew install unrar
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow
1. **Launch** the application: `python main.py`
2. **Select Archive**: Choose your password-protected ZIP or RAR file
3. **Select Password List**: Choose a text file with candidate passwords
4. **Configure Options**: Set worker threads and enhancement preferences
5. **Start Testing**: Click "Start Password Testing" to begin
6. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time progress and results

### Configuration Options

#### Worker Threads
- **Conservative**: Light CPU usage, good for background operation
- **Recommended**: Optimal balance (default, auto-detected)
- **Aggressive**: Maximum speed, higher CPU usage

#### Password Enhancement
- **Enabled** (default): Generates variations using common substitutions
- **Disabled**: Tests only original passwords from your list

#### Theme Selection
- **Light Theme**: Professional appearance for normal lighting
- **Dark Theme**: Comfortable viewing in low-light environments

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Main Thread**: UI and user interaction
- **Coordinator Thread**: Manages password distribution and results
- **Worker Threads**: Parallel password testing (configurable count)
- **Queue System**: Thread-safe password distribution

### Password Enhancement Algorithm
```python
Substitutions:
a/A → @, 4    |    e/E → 3    |    i/I → 1, !
o/O → 0       |    s/S → $, 5  |    t/T → 7
l/L → 1       |    g/G → 9     |    b/B → 6

Common Endings: 123, !, 1, 12, 2023, 2024, 01
Capitalization: First letter variants
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Resource Detection**: Automatic CPU core detection
- **Load Balancing**: Efficient work distribution
- **Memory Management**: Optimized queue sizes
- **Early Exit**: Immediate termination on success

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

**Example Performance (20-core system):**
| Workers | Speed (passwords/sec) | Speedup | Recommended For |
|---------|----------------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1       | 636                  | 1.0x    | Baseline        |
| 5       | 3,170                | 5.0x    | Small lists     |
| 10      | 5,968                | 9.4x    | Medium lists    |
| 20      | 10,808               | 17.0x   | Large lists     |

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Password List Security
- Store password lists securely
- Delete sensitive files after use
- Use encrypted storage for password lists
- Avoid sharing password lists

### System Security
- Run with minimal privileges
- Monitor system resource usage
- Keep software updated
- Use in isolated environments for testing
